- Firstly you need to clone the project via SSH to your site location.Cause you can be confirmed that your ssh is working or not. Which will also easy to understand the process. I use snippets for quick. You can follow this one for better solution :

- https://github.com/marketplace/actions/laravel-deploy

- A Github action workflow is a set of instructions that consists different jobs and steps that can be triggered on events we mentioned above.

- Workflows for a repository are stored inside .github/workflows in the root directory of your applications.

Usage
