- Firstly you need to clone the project via SSH to your site location.Cause you can be confirmed that your ssh is working or not. Which will also easy to understand the process. I use snippets for quick. You can follow this one for better solution :

<h2>Create a workflow</h2>

- A Github action workflow is a set of instructions that consists different jobs and steps that can be triggered on events we mentioned above.

- Workflows for a repository are stored inside .github/workflows in the root directory of your applications.

- create a file called deploy.yml inside .github/workflows folder with the following content.

```yml
name: deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install SSH Key
        uses: shimataro/ssh-key-action@v2
        with:
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          known_hosts: unnecessary

      - name: Adding Known Hosts
        run: ssh-keyscan -p ${{ secrets.SSH_PORT}} -H ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}  >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

      - name: Start Deploying
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          port: ${{ secrets.SSH_PORT }}
          passphrase: ${{ secrets.PASSPHRASE }}
          script: |
            ls
            cd domain.com/public_html/
            php82 artisan down || true
            git pull
            composer install 
            php82 artisan migrate
            php82 artisan optimize:clear
            php82 artisan up
```
