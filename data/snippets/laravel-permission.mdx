- Never set a directory to 777. you should change directory ownership. so set your current user that you are logged in with as owner and the webserver user (www-data, apache, ...) as the group. You can try this:

```bash
$ sudo chown -R $USER:www-data storage
$ sudo chown -R $USER:www-data bootstrap/cache
```

- then to set directory permission try this:

```bash
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
```
