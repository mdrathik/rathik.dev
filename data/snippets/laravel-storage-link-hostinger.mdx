## Understanding Laravel Storage Link

Laravel's storage link command creates a symbolic link from the `public/storage` directory to the `storage/app/public` directory:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

This allows publicly accessible files (like user uploads) to be stored in the `storage/app/public` directory while being accessible through the `public/storage` URL path. If the link already exists, the command will notify you.

## The Issue on Hostinger Shared Hosting

Everything seems fine when you run the command on Hostinger - no errors appear. However, there's a problem: **the command doesn't actually create a working symbolic link to `public/storage`**.

Your files remain inaccessible even though Laravel says the link was created successfully.

## The Solution

To properly create the storage link on Hostinger shared hosting, run this command instead:

```bash
ln -s $(pwd)/storage/app/public $(pwd)/public/storage
```

This command will solve the storage link issue and your files will be accessible immediately.

### Why This Works

- Uses absolute paths via `$(pwd)` instead of relative paths
- Creates a proper symbolic link that Hostinger's file system actually recognizes
- Bypasses the compatibility issues between Laravel's artisan command and Hostinger's environment
