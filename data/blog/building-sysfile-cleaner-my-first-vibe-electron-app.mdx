I am not so excited to share the story of how I built my first desktop application using Electron.js - [SysFile Cleaner](https://github.com/mdrathik/SysFile-Cleaner). This project wasn't just a technical exercise, it was fun to solve that stupid problem.

## The Real Problem

Our operations team faced a daily challenge: they needed to deliver more than 5000+ files across 100-300 different folders to our cloud storage. The major pain point? These folders were cluttered with system metadata files like `thumbs.db` and `.DS_Store`. The team had two options, both equally frustrating:

1. Manually enter each folder and delete these files one by one
2. Use Windows Explorer's search function to find and delete them

Both methods were incredibly time-consuming and error-prone. This manual cleanup process was eating up hours of their valuable time every single day. That's when I decided to take action.

## Why I Built It

I thought to myself: "Why not use Cursor to solve this problem once and for all?" I wanted to create a solution that would:

- Automate the tedious cleanup process(Only for our internal use)
- Save the operations team countless minutes.
- Ensure only actual files are moved to the cloud
- Make the process hassle-free and reliable

The goal was simple: create a tool that would let the team focus on their actual work rather than spending time on file cleanup.

## Tech Stack

The application is built using:

- Electron.js for cross-platform desktop application
- HTML/CSS for the user interface
- JavaScript for the core functionality

## Key Features

- 🔍 Scans directories recursivlys for system metadata files
- 🧹 Clean and simple interface for easy file cleanup
- 📊 Real-time progress tracking
- 💻 Cross-platform support
- 📈 Shows total files found and cleaned

## Development Experience

Building this app was a great learning experience. Some key takeaways:

1. **Electron's Architecture**: Understanding the main process and renderer process was crucial. The main process handles file system operations, while the renderer process manages the UI.

2. **Cross-Platform Considerations**: Ensuring the app works seamlessly across Windows and macOS required careful handling of file paths and system-specific behaviors.

## Getting Started

The app is open-source and available on GitHub. You can:

- Download the latest release for your platform
- Clone the repository and run it locally
- Contribute to the project

## Future Plans

I'm planning to add more features like:

- Currently i havent any future plan. Cause its very tiny app for tiny problem that makes crazy.

Building vibe is amazing !
