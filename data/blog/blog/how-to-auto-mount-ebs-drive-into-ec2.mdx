Before going ahead with this, you have to be connected to your EC2 via SSH, you can check from this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html 'link') how to connect. Also need to create an EBS volume and [attach it to the EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html 'How to Attach ebs Volume to Ec2 ').

## How to Mount EBS on EC2

**Step 1**: Let's check if the attached volume on ec2 by this

    lsblk

It will return like this output

    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    xvda    202:0    0    8G  0 disk
    -xvda1  202:1    0    8G  0 part /
    xvdf    202:80   0   10G  0 disk

**Step 2:** so now need to check the volume if there has any data.
`sudo file -s /dev/xvdf `

If the output looks like this “`/dev/xvdf: data`“, its meaning your volume is empty.

**Step 3**: Now we need to format it with ex4
`sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf`
**Step 4:** Create a directory where you want to mount and the mount command

```
    sudo mkdir /yournewvolume

    sudo mount /dev/xvdf /yournewvolume/`
```

**Step 5:** change the directory to yournewvolume by

```
    cd yournewvolume

    df -h .
```

by entering df -h . will show you the volume space on that directory.

If once the ec2 instance stop/restart it will unmount again, so if need auto-mount when the ec2 restart, follow this command below.

## Auto Mount EBS on EC2

**Step 1:** For security, please Back up the /etc/fstab file.

```
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
```

**Step 2:** open with nano or vim to this now

```
  sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Now add this line at the end.

```
/dev/xvdf       /yournewvolume   ext4    defaults,nofail        0       0
```

**Step 3:** Run this command below to check any errors found to not. if there is no error, that means its finally done.

    sudo mount -a

Now you can reboot the instance and check.

## How many EBS can attach to EC2?

The answer is 20. This the max number you are able to add.
