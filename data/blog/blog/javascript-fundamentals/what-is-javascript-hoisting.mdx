## Introduction

When you load your javascript to browser, javascript engine executes it and create global execution context. That has two phases.

- Creation
- Execution

Hosting happens on when the phase on creation mode, the javascript engine moves the Variable and Function declaration to the top of the scope.

## Variable Hoisting

Lets run the Example : 1 code first.

Example : 1

```Javascript
console.log(name);   // undefined
var name = "JavaScript";
```

Hope it doesn't make an error and showing <em><strong>"undefined"</strong></em>. Cause Javascript moves the Variable declaration top of the scope.

okay, just run Example : 2 code

Example : 2

```Javascript
var name;
console.log(name);   // undefined
var name = "JavaScript";
```

I think , still you got the same result on example two.

Its meaning during the creation phase, <em><strong>var name </strong></em> automatically declare to the top & initialize value <em><strong>"undefined"</strong></em>

## Function Hoisting

Lets run the Example : 1 code first.

Example : 1

```Javascript
let result = add(20, 30);
console.log(result);

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Like as Variable Javascript engine hoisted the function to the top.

Example : 2

```Javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
let result = add(30, 30);
console.log(result);
```

If you compare the output both are giving same result. During the creating phase the <strong>function add</strong> automatically move to the top of scope.

Note :

- Unlike var, they are not initialized with a default value while hoisting.
- They cannot be read/written until they have been fully initialized.
- Javscript hoisting not working
  arrow function and expression.
