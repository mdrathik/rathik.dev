![laravel form request has file](/static/images/rathik-laravel.jpg)

In this article you will learn how to check file request by form submission. Suppose you will upload a file and submit form then if your form submission has file your output will dd the file.

1.  Just create a form like this

```html
<form action="{{route('fileUpload')}}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <div class="custom-file">
    <input type="file" name="photo" class="custom-file-input" id="chooseFile" />
    <label class="custom-file-label" for="chooseFile">Select file</label>
  </div>
  <button type="submit" name="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-block mt-4">Upload Files</button>
</form>
```

2.  Make sure your route is matching with form action.

3.  Now check if your request has file.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ProfileController extends Controller
{

    public function ProfilePicture(Request $request)
    {
        $request->validate([
            'name' => 'required',
            'photo' => 'required',
        ]);

        if ($request->hasFile('photo')) {
            dd($request->photo);
        }
    }
}
```
