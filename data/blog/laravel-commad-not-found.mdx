## Fix Laravel Command not found in ZSH or BASH in Ubuntu/WSL2

Make sure you have added laravel via composer. Just Type this command in terminal and hit enter.

```bash
$ composer global require "laravel/installer"
```

### For zsh and bash:

```bash
$ cd ~
$ export PATH="$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
$ source ~/.zshrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

### For bash only:

```bash
$ cd ~
$ export PATH=~/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Note :
if still you are getting that error again, please edit .zshrc/.bashrc and add path manually path.

```bash
$ nano ~/.zshrc
```

add this line

```bash
export PATH=~/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
```

Press 'ctrl+s' for save and 'ctrl+x' to exit.
