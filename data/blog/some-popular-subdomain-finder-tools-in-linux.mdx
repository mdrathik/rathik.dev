# Discover Hidden Subdomains with These Popular Linux Tools

Are you looking for a way to find subdomains of a website? There are several powerful tools available in Linux that can help you uncover subdomains. In this article, we will explore some popular subdomain finder tools and guide you through the installation and usage of each one.

## Step 1: Install Sublist3r

[Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) is a popular Python-based tool designed for subdomain discovery. It is simple to use and efficient.

### Installation

To install Sublist3r, run the following command:

```bash
pip install sublist3r
```

## Step 2: Use Sublist3r to Find Subdomains

Once installed, you can use Sublist3r to find subdomains of a website. To discover the subdomains of a website, run the following command:

```bash
sublist3r -d example.com
```

This will fetch all the subdomains of `example.com` and display them in the terminal.

## Step 3: Install Amass

[Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass) is another highly regarded tool for subdomain enumeration. It provides more advanced features for discovering subdomains and mapping attack surfaces.

### Installation

To install Amass, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install amass
```

## Step 4: Use Amass to Find Subdomains

Once Amass is installed, you can use it to find subdomains by running the following command:

```bash
amass enum -d example.com
```

This will search for and list all the subdomains of `example.com`.

## Step 5: Install Knockpy

[Knockpy](https://github.com/guelfoweb/knockpy) is a Python-based tool that also helps in discovering subdomains. It has a wordlist-based approach and is very effective in brute-forcing subdomains.

### Installation

You can install Knockpy using pip:

```bash
pip install knockpy
```

## Step 6: Use Knockpy to Find Subdomains

After installation, you can use Knockpy to identify subdomains. Simply run:

```bash
knockpy example.com
```

This will initiate a scan for all subdomains of `example.com`.

## Other Useful Tools

Apart from the tools mentioned above, there are several other popular subdomain discovery tools available for Linux, including:

- **dnsrecon**: A DNS reconnaissance tool for finding subdomains.
- **theHarvester**: A tool for gathering information about domains and emails.
- **subbrute**: A fast subdomain brute-forcing tool.

These tools can be installed via `pip` or `apt-get` and provide additional methods to find subdomains.

## Conclusion

Subdomain discovery is a crucial step in security assessments, penetration testing, and bug bounty hunting. The tools mentioned above are some of the best options available on Linux for discovering hidden subdomains.
