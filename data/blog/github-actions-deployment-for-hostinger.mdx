## Stop Uploading Files Manually Like It's 2010! 🚀

So you've been deploying to Hostinger by manually uploading files via FTP? Or worse, SSHing in and running git pull every single time you make a change? Yeah, I've been there too. It's 2025, and we deserve better!

Let me show you how I set up automatic deployment for my Laravel projects on Hostinger using GitHub Actions. It's actually way simpler than you think!

## What We're Building

Every time you push to your `main` branch, GitHub Actions will automatically:

- SSH into your Hostinger server
- Pull the latest code
- Install dependencies
- Run migrations
- Clear and optimize caches
- Fix those annoying symlink issues on shared hosting

Basically, it does everything you'd do manually, but without you lifting a finger. Sweet, right?

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have:

- A Laravel project on GitHub
- Hostinger hosting with SSH access
- Your deployment credentials ready

That's it! No fancy tools or complicated setups needed.

## Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Secrets

First things first - we need to store your server credentials securely. Head over to your GitHub repo and go to:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

Add these secrets:

- `HOST` - Your server IP or domain
- `USERNAME` - Your SSH username
- `PASSWORD` - Your SSH password (yeah, I know SSH keys are better, but passwords work fine for quick setups)
- `PORT` - Usually 22, but check your Hostinger docs
- `LOCATION` - The full path to your project on the server (like `/home/username/public_html`)

Pro tip: Don't share these with anyone. They're called secrets for a reason! 😉

## Step 2: Create the GitHub Actions Workflow

Now for the fun part! Create a new file in your repo:

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Here's the complete workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Server

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy via SSH
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
          port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
          script: |
            cd ${{ secrets.LOCATION }}
            git pull origin main

            # Install PHP dependencies
            composer install --optimize-autoloader

            # Run migrations and seeders
            php artisan migrate --force

            # Shared Hosting Symlink Fix
            rm -rf public/storage
            ln -s $(pwd)/storage/app/public $(pwd)/public/storage

            # Optimize Laravel
            php artisan optimize
            php artisan view:cache
            php artisan config:cache
```

## Breaking It Down (So It Actually Makes Sense)

Let me explain what each part does:

### The Trigger

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

This tells GitHub: "Hey, whenever someone pushes to the main branch, run this workflow." You can change `main` to whatever branch you use for production.

### Checkout Code

```yaml
- name: Checkout Code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

This just grabs your latest code. Nothing crazy here.

### The SSH Magic

```yaml
- name: Deploy via SSH
  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
```

This is where the magic happens! We're using this awesome action that handles SSH connections for us. Much easier than writing custom scripts.

### The Deployment Script

The script section is literally the commands you'd run manually. Let's break them down:

**1. Navigate and Pull**

```bash
cd ${{ secrets.LOCATION }}
git pull origin main
```

Goes to your project folder and pulls the latest code.

**2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
composer install --optimize-autoloader
```

Installs all your PHP packages. The `--optimize-autoloader` flag makes it faster!

**3. Run Migrations**

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
```

Updates your database. The `--force` flag is needed for production environments.

**4. Fix Symlinks**

```bash
rm -rf public/storage
ln -s $(pwd)/storage/app/public $(pwd)/public/storage
```

This is super important for shared hosting! It recreates the storage symlink because shared hosting can be weird about this.

**5. Optimize Everything**

```bash
php artisan optimize
php artisan view:cache
php artisan config:cache
```

Makes your app run faster by caching configs and views.

## Step 3: Test It Out!

Commit this workflow file and push it to GitHub:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```

Now head over to your GitHub repo and click on the **Actions** tab. You should see your workflow running!

If everything goes green ✅, congrats! Your deployment is automated.

If it fails ❌, don't panic. Check the logs - they're usually pretty clear about what went wrong. Common issues:

- Wrong credentials in secrets
- Wrong server path
- SSH not enabled on your Hostinger account
- File permission issues

## Pro Tips & Things I Learned The Hard Way

### 1. Test on a Staging Branch First

Before automating production, create a `staging` branch and test there. Future you will thank present you!

### 2. Watch Out for .env Files

Your `.env` file isn't in Git (and shouldn't be!), so make sure it exists on your server. The workflow won't create it for you.

### 3. Add Slack/Discord Notifications

You can extend this workflow to send you notifications when deployments succeed or fail. Super useful!

### 4. Database Backups

Always, ALWAYS back up your database before running migrations in production. I learned this the hard way 😅

### 5. Composer Memory Issues?

If you hit memory limits, you can add this before composer install:

```bash
export COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1
```

## What About SSH Keys Instead of Passwords?

Yeah, SSH keys are more secure. If you want to use them instead:

1. Generate a key pair on your local machine
2. Add the public key to your Hostinger server
3. Add the private key as a GitHub secret called `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
4. Update your workflow to use `key` instead of `password`

But honestly, for most small projects, passwords work just fine.

## Wrapping Up

That's it! You now have a fully automated deployment pipeline for your Laravel app on Hostinger. Every time you push to main, your changes go live automatically.

No more:

- ❌ Manual file uploads
- ❌ Forgetting to run migrations
- ❌ Cache issues in production
- ❌ "Works on my machine" problems

Just:

- ✅ Push your code
- ✅ Watch the magic happen
- ✅ Grab a coffee while it deploys

This setup has saved me hours of deployment time and countless headaches. Hope it does the same for you!

_P.S. - This workflow works for most Laravel apps, but you might need to tweak it based on your specific setup. Don't be afraid to customize it to fit your needs!_
