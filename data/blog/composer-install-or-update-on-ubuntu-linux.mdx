If you are already on the LAMP stack, then this post will help to quickly set up the composer. Spacially for the version which hasn't self-update available. Let's get started.

You can check if the composer is already available on your computer by this command,  
`$ which composer`

in this case, my computer returns**/usr/bin/composer .** if there is nothing return like mine. Don't worry just follow the steps below.

### To download Composer

it will download the composer in current directory.<br />

`php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer','composer-setup.php');"`

### TO Create composer.phar

it will create this in same (Current) directory.<br />
`php composer-setup.php`

### Final step to move the composer.phar

Replace **/usr/bin/composer** with the result returned from step 1. after this you are able to run composer globally.<br />

`sudo mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer`

If it's successfully installed, the output will be the same as the screenshot below.
