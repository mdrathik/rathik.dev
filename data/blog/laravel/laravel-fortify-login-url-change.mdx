![laravel fortify login url change](/static/images/rathik-laravel.jpg)

Hi Fokls,
This is common asking question when you need to change the laravl login url in fortify. Somedays ago i tried many ways to change the fortify login url. So after i got this method below and its tested. Its Working efficiently, you can check this example.

1. Firstly go to your `FortifyServiceProvider` and now you have add this below code in `boot()` method

```php
Fortify::ignoreRoutes();
```

now its look like

```php
  public function boot()
    {
        Fortify::ignoreRoutes(); // <<< ADDED THIS LINE

        // Below is the default configuration that comes with this provider
        // If you changed it, you can keep your changes
        Fortify::createUsersUsing(CreateNewUser::class);
        Fortify::updateUserProfileInformationUsing(UpdateUserProfileInformation::class);
        Fortify::updateUserPasswordsUsing(UpdateUserPassword::class);
        Fortify::resetUserPasswordsUsing(ResetUserPassword::class);
    }
```

2. Then copy Fortify's routes definitions to your ./routes/web.php file.

3. Then go to web.php, need to keep the controllers imports file and you can make changes accordingly.
