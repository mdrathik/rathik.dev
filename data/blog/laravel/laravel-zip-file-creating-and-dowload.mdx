how to make a zip file from a folder and download it in Laravel step by step. In this php laravel  application, we will produce a zip file by utilizing the zip-archive class.

Lets demonstrate how to implement a very simple zip file method in a Laravel application. So let's see a few items steps and consider them as an example. I will show you two method.

## Fist Method which is using ZipArchive Class

1.  Setup Laravel

```bash
Route::get('download-zip-file', [ZipDownloadController::class, 'downloadZipFile']);
```

2. The same as with route above, we will add one new route method here. downloadZipFile() will build a new zip file and download it as a response, so Please add this line.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use File;
use ZipArchive;

class ZipDownloadController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function downloadZipFile()
    {
        $zip = new ZipArchive;

        $fileName = 'myFolder.zip';

        if ($zip->open(public_path($fileName), ZipArchive::CREATE) === TRUE)
        {
            $files = File::files(public_path('myFolder'));

            foreach ($files as $key => $value) {
                $relativeNameInZipFile = basename($value);
                $zip->addFile($value, $relativeNameInZipFile);
            }
            $zip->close();
        }
        return response()->download(public_path($fileName));
    }
}

```

**NOTE** :
Make sure you have myFolder in your public path/directory.

---

3. Now run your project with this command `php artisan serve` to start developement server.

4. Now please go the route like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/download-zip-file` from your browser, it will make the folder zip and download automatically.

## Second Method : Using open-source Laravel Zip Package

1.  We are keeping same route to make it quick

```bash
Route::get('download-zip-file', [ZipDownloadController::class, 'downloadZipFile']);
```

2. Go to controoller and just follow this `downloadZipFile` method.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use File;
use ZipArchive;

class ZipDownloadController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Display a listing of the resource.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function downloadZipFile()
    {
        //only add this code.
       	return Zip::create('myFolder.zip', File::files(public_path('myFolder')));
    }
}

```

**NOTE** :
Make sure you have myFolder in your public path/directory.

---

3. Now run your project with this command `php artisan serve` to start developement server again.Go the route, thats will create zip folder at your public path.

From avobe two method i personally prefer 2nd one. Cause thats easy to handle and quick.
hope both method is working, if not please feel free to comment.
