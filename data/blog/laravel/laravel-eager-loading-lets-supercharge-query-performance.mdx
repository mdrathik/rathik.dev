Hello everyone! Today we are going to talk about "Laravel Eager Loading" which is a great way to improve query performance in your Laravel apps. Are you ready to make your Laravel app super fast? Let's get started!

## **Setting Up Our Models**

Before we dive into eager loading, let's first set up our models. In our Laravel application, we have two models - **`Post`** and **`Category`**. Here's how they look:

### **The Post Model**

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;
    public function category()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Category::class);
    }
}
```

This is our Post model. Each post belongs to a category.

### **The Category Model**

```php
class Category extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);
    }
}
```

And this is our Category model. A category can have many posts.

Now, let's say we want to display all our posts along with their respective categories.

## **The Problem with Lazy Loading**

If we use the following code to get all our posts:

```php
phpCopy code
$posts = Post::get();
//retrive all post
```

Although this code gets all the posts, it's not very efficient. It's like loading each category seprately . This is called "Lazy Loading." Laravel loads the category for each post individually when it's accessed.

## **Boosting Performance with Eager Loading**

Eager loading in Laravel means that instead of getting related data separately for each post, Laravel can get everything at once. This makes the query more efficient and improves performance.

Here's how to implement eager loading in Laravel:

```php
phpCopy code
$posts = Post::with('category')->get();
// Retrieve all posts with their category information
```

By using the **`with`** method, we're telling Laravel to load all related categories at the same time when retrieving the posts. This results in a more efficient query and a noticeable performance improvement for your application.
