Hello everyone!
Um Rathik! I've been knee-deep in PHP & Laravel for the last 5 years, exploring, learning, and growing every single day. Now, I want to share some of that knowledge with you.We're going to dive into four super useful Eloquent methods in Laravel: `withCount`, `withSum`, `withAvg`, and `withExists`. These methods are handy tools. What is the best part? These methods work seamlessly with Laravel 6, Laravel 7, Laravel 8, Laravel 9, and even the latest Laravel 10 version.

So, buckle up and let's get started!

**Creating our Eloquent Models**

Before we proceed, let's define the structure of our application. We will be working with two models, **`Book`** and **`Author`**. Each **`Author`** can have multiple **`Books`**.

**Creating our Eloquent Models**

Before we proceed, let's define the structure of our application. We will be working with two models, **`Book`** and **`Author`**. Each **`Author`** can have multiple **`Books`**.

_Author Model:_

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Author extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    public function books()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Book::class);
    }
}

```

_Book Model:_

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Book extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $fillable = [
        'title', 'price'
    ];
}
```

**Using Laravel's withCount Method**

The **`withCount`** method in Laravel allows you to count the number of related records for each model without executing N+1 queries. This method enhances the performance of your Laravel application by reducing the overall number of queries made to the database. Here's how you can use it:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Author;

class BookController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $authors = Author::select("id", "name")
                        ->withCount('books')
                        ->get()
                        ->toArray();

        dd($authors);
    }
}
```

The output will be an array that includes the count of books each author has written.

**Using Laravel's withCount Method with Where Clause**

The **`withCount`** method also allows for the application of conditions using the **`where`** clause.

```php
$authors = Author::withCount(['books' => function ($query) {
            $query->where('published', 1);
        }])->get();
```

This example counts only the books that have been published (**`published = 1`**).

**Leveraging Laravel's withSum Method**

In a similar fashion, Laravel's **`withSum`** method allows us to sum a particular column's value in a related model. In this example, we'll sum the prices of all books each author has written.

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Author;

class BookController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $authors = Author::select("id", "name")
                        ->withSum('books', 'price')
                        ->get()
                        ->toArray();

        dd($authors);
    }
}
```

The output will be an array that includes the sum of the prices of all books each author has written.

**Understanding Laravel's withAvg Method**

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Author;

class BookController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $authors = Author::select("id", "name")
                        ->withAvg('books', 'price')
                        ->get()
                        ->toArray();

        dd($authors);
    }
}
```

This code will work assuming that your **`Author`** model has a **`books`** relationship defined and the **`Book`** model has a **`price`** field.

**Using Laravel's withExists Method**

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Author;

class BookController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $authors = Author::select("id", "name")
                        ->withExists('books')
                        ->get()
                        ->toArray();

        dd($authors);
    }
}
```

This code will work if your **`Author`** model has a **`books`** relationship defined.

Laravel's Eloquent ORM is jam-packed with features that make database wrangling feel less like a chore and more like a walk in the park. The **`withCount`**, **`withSum`**, **`withAvg`**, and **`withExists`** methods are just a sneak peek into how Eloquent can take the complexity out of managing database relationships.

Feel free to knock me if this code is not working or any help regarding this. hello@rathik.dev
