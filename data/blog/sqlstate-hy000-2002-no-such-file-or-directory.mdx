There are lots of DEV still using xampp for laravel & php development environmemt. To be honest i used that long time.

From few months, have been using laravel sail (WSL2+Docker), its amazing. But i got an issue after first "sail up" command. Somehow i got error when trying to migrate database by sail artisan migrate.

Looking for solution, tried many things. but wasn't success. But also got some solution , dont knwo which is efficiant. Somehow it works. I am not so experined in docker, co acn't suggest you about better.

## Error : SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory

### first Solution

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=sail
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

### second Solution

```bash
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=your wsl2 ip
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=sail
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

I prefer first solution over second one. Cause you don't need to change the ip manully all the time.

Thanks
